On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them, though it was not I, but the grace of God that is with me. (1 Corinthians 15:10)\nGrace is not only God\u2019s disposition to do good for us when we don\u2019t deserve it. It is an actual power from God that acts and makes good things happen in us and for us.\nGod\u2019s grace was God\u2019s acting in Paul to make Paul work hard. So when Paul says, \u201cWork out your salvation,\u201d he adds, \u201cit is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure\u201d (Philippians 2:13). Grace is power from God to do good things in us and for us.\nThis grace is past and it is future. It is ever cascading over the infinitesimal waterfall of the present from the inexhaustible river of grace coming to us from the future into the ever-increasing reservoir of grace in the past.\nIn the next five minutes, you will receive sustaining grace flowing to you from the future, and you will accumulate another five minutes\u2019 worth of grace in the reservoir of the past. The proper response to grace you experienced in the past is gratitude, and the proper response to grace promised to you in the future is faith. We are thankful for the past grace of the last year, and we are confident in future grace for the new year.", "title":
